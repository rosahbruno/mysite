            i was a member of the mars app team (clinical data archive of 30+ years). i was able to get
            involved in a variety of projects involving: our new ui built in <a
              href="https://www.polymer-project.org/">polymer</a>, <a href="https://spark.apache.org/">spark</a>
            + <a href="https://www.scala-lang.org/">scala</a> jobs for clinical record ingestion, created ui mockups +
            system design diagrams,
            as well as automating a large # of legacy processes. during my time there i cut our daily time spent
            maintaining our legacy system from 2 hours to >10 minutes.
            <br /><br />
            i led multiple projects including: all of our team's work for the hospital-wide standardization of lab
            codes,
            re-structuring of our entire result code db, building a ui to allow clinicians to manage messages that
            failed to
            parse through mars, a full support wiki overhaul, as well as building + maintaining our legacy clinical
            record parsers.
            <br /><br />
            i was involved in our support rotation, spent time doing data quality, participating in test events, and
            general system
            maintenance.
